# Advanced-Data-Structures-in-Java-Course

This is the final project for the Advanced Data Structures in Java course in Cousera: https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures

It is an interactive map with with graph data (insersections as nodes and roads as edges).


The following algorithms to find routes between intersections across cities were implemented:


- Breadth First Seacrch
- Dijkstra
- A*
- A* Arrival Time
